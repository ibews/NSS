Given is the following grammar:

S -> NP VP
NP -> Det N0
NP -> Det A0 N0
VP -> V1
VP -> V1 PP
V1 -> Finite-Verb
V1 -> Finite-Verb NP
PP -> P0 NP

and the sentence:

The black cat chases the dog into the shed.

a) Add the lexical rules for the grammars.
b) Illustrate the working of the top-down parsing algorithm (cf. Grammatiken
   und Parsing (slides 17ff.)) using the above example. Show the analysis trace
   as a table (analysis steps and backup states while handling the possibility
   list as a queue) as well as the search tree.
   
Det -> the
N0 -> cat dog shed
A0 -> black
P0 -> into
Finite-Verb -> chases
