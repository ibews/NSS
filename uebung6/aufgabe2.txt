Given is the following grammar:

S -> NP VP
NP -> Det N0
NP -> Det A0 N0
VP -> V1
VP -> V1 PP
V1 -> Finite-Verb
V1 -> Finite-Verb NP
PP -> P0 NP

and the sentence:

The black cat chases the dog into the shed.

a) Add the lexical rules for the grammars.
b) Illustrate the working of the bottom-up parsing strategy (cf. Grammatiken
   und Parsing (slides 11, 12)) by presenting the rewriting steps of a
   successful parse using the above example.

Det -> The
N0 -> cat dog shed
A0 -> black
P0 -> into
Finite-Verb -> chases

Det black cat chases the dog into the shed.
Det A0 cat chases the dog into the shed.
Det A0 N0 chases the dog into the shed.
Det A0 N0 Finite-Verb the dog into the shed.
Det A0 N0 Finite-Verb Det dog into the shed.
Det A0 N0 Finite-Verb Det N0 into the shed.
Det A0 N0 Finite-Verb Det N0 P0 the shed.
Det A0 N0 Finite-Verb Det N0 P0 Det shed.
Det A0 N0 Finite-Verb Det N0 P0 Det N0.
